## 🧩 Project Description

The BMW Sales Performance Analysis Dashboard (2010–2024) provides a detailed overview of BMW’s sales trends and performance indicators across multiple dimensions such as models, regions, fuel types, transmission types, and sales classifications.

Developed using Power BI, the project transforms raw sales data into an interactive analytical dashboard with custom DAX measures for key performance insights like total revenue, units sold, average price, and year-over-year growth.

The dashboard is structured into three analytical pages:

Executive Summary – Displays key KPIs (Revenue, Units Sold, Average Price, YoY Growth) along with overall sales trends and revenue distribution by category.

Model Performance – Focuses on performance by model, showing revenue, units sold, and price comparisons through bar, line, and scatter visuals.

Market Insights – Highlights insights by fuel type, transmission, color, and region with interactive filters and dynamic visual breakdowns.
